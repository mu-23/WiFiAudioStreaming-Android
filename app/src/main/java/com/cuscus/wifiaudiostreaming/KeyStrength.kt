/**
 * A rough strength estimate for a manually typed pre-shared key, shown live under
 * the key field as a red → amber → green meter.
 *
 * It exists because of the one weakness deliberately left in the protocol: the
 * server answers an unauthenticated HELLO with an HMAC over the key, which is a
 * sample for an offline dictionary attack. Against a random key (QR pairing) that
 * goes nowhere; against a short hand-typed one it is real. Rather than impose a
 * hard minimum, the meter puts the choice — and the length — in front of the user.
 *
 * The estimate is intentionally simple and self-contained: pooled bits from the
 * character classes present, scaled by the ratio of distinct characters so that
 * "aaaaaaaa" does not read as long. It is guidance, not a gate; the exact same
 * math runs on the desktop so both ends agree on what "strong" means.
